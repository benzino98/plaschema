# Plaschema Project Rules and Patterns

## Code Style

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards for PHP
- Use camelCase for variables and methods
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use snake_case for database columns
- Use ; and not && for combining powershell commands

## Project Structure

- Keep controllers thin, move business logic to services
- Use repositories for complex database queries
- Store global helpers in dedicated helper files
- Organize CSS/JS by component when possible

## Implementation Patterns

- Use Laravel's built-in features instead of reinventing solutions
- Prefer dependency injection over facade usage in complex classes
- Use form requests for validation logic
- Use resource controllers for CRUD operations

## Documentation Requirements

- Add DocBlocks to classes and methods
- Document all non-trivial code blocks with comments
- Keep README updated with installation and configuration instructions
- Document API endpoints if created

## Development Workflow

- Create migrations for all database changes
- Use feature branches for new features
- Keep commits focused and descriptive

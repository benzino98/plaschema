     - Sender information: name, email, phone
     - Message details: subject, message
     - Status tracking: status (new, read, responded, archived), is_read
     - Admin tracking: responded_by, responded_at
     - Archiving: archived_at, auto_archive
   - âœ… Create database migration and model for message categories:
     - Categories: General Inquiry, Enrollment Question, Provider Question, Feedback, Technical Issue
     - Fields: name, description, slug, priority
   - âœ… Develop ContactMessageRepository and MessageCategoryRepository
   - âœ… Implement ContactMessageService with business logic
   - âœ… Create form request validation for message submissions
   - âœ… Create controllers for public submission and admin management
   - âœ… Build admin interface for message management with:
     - Message listing with filters for status, category, date
     - Message detail view with response functionality
     - Category management interface
   - âœ… Configure super admin only permissions for message management

2. Improve mobile responsiveness

   - Implement email verification
   - Build user profile management

2. Add advanced search functionality

   - Create dedicated search page with filters
   - Implement full-text search for content
   - Add location-based search for healthcare providers

3. Set up caching strategy
   - Implement Redis for caching
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Add cache invalidation on content updates

### Long-term (Next Quarter)

1. API Development

   - Create RESTful API endpoints for major resources
   - Implement API authentication
   - Document API with Swagger/OpenAPI

2. Analytics and Reporting

   - Implement dashboard for key metrics
   - Create exportable reports
   - Set up automated report generation

3. Performance optimization
   - Conduct load testing
   - Implement queuing for resource-intensive operations
   - Optimize database indexes and queries

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication Strategy**: Using Laravel Breeze with our implemented role-based permissions system for granular access control. Permission checks are now applied to all admin controllers.

2. **Activity Logging Approach**: Successfully implemented a dedicated service for activity logging with controller-level integration for all main admin actions (create, update, delete). Entity-specific log views provide focused audit trails for each module with filtering options by action type and date range.

3. **Image Processing Approach**: Currently using Intervention Image for processing uploads. Considering implementing a queue-based approach for larger uploads to improve performance.

4. **Testing Priority**: Focusing on feature tests for critical admin operations first, then expanding to browser tests. Need to add tests for the newly implemented permission system and activity logging functionality.

5. **Caching Implementation**: Evaluating options between Redis, Memcached, or file-based caching based on performance needs and infrastructure constraints.

6. **Contact Message Management**:
   - Messages will be stored in the database with automatic archiving after 3 months
   - Using in-app notifications for new messages (no email notifications)
   - Admin users will mark messages as "responded to" after replying from their email client
   - Implementing message categories to aid in triaging
   - Only showing a simple success message to users after form submission
   - Restricting message management to super admin role only

### Design & UX Decisions

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Improved mobile experience in admin area. Need to evaluate usability on various devices.

2. **Form Feedback Strategy**: Implementing immediate inline validation feedback rather than submitting the form to show errors.

3. **Admin Dashboard Layout**: Redesigning the admin dashboard to show key metrics and recent activities for better at-a-glance information.

4. **Theming System**: Considering the implementation of a light/dark mode toggle based on user preferences.

5. **Contact Message Interface**: Implementing a clean listing interface with status indicators, filtering options by category and status, and a detailed view for individual messages with response tracking.

### Product Decisions

1. **Feature Prioritization**: Healthcare provider search and filtering features have been prioritized based on user feedback.

2. **Content Management Flow**: Streamlining the content creation process with a more intuitive workflow.

3. **User Account Requirements**: Determining what level of user registration is required for public site features.

4. **Contact Message Workflow**:
   - New messages will be flagged in the admin interface
   - Super admin will review and can update status (new â†’ read â†’ responded â†’ archived)
   - Implementing predefined categories: General Inquiry, Enrollment Question, Provider Question, Feedback, Technical Issue
   - Messages will be automatically archived after 3 months
   - No internal notes functionality needed

### Current Challenges

1. **Activity Log Volume**: Managing potential high volume of activity logs over time (consider log rotation or archiving).

2. **Image Upload Performance**: Large image uploads causing performance issues in the admin interface.

3. **Test Data Generation**: Creating realistic test data that covers edge cases for comprehensive testing.

4. **Responsive Image Handling**: Implementing proper responsive image solutions for various device sizes and connection speeds.

5. **Contact Message Notifications**: Implementing effective in-app notification system for new contact messages to ensure timely responses.

## Team Focus

- **Backend Development**: Shifting focus to performance optimization, caching implementation, and contact page backend functionality
- **Frontend Development**: Completing mobile responsiveness and form UX improvements
- **QA & Testing**: Expanding test coverage for new permissions system and activity logging features
- **DevOps**: Setting up deployment pipeline for staging environment

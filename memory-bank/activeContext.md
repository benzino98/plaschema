# Active Context: PLASCHEMA Project

## Current Focus

We have successfully implemented the multilingual support system for PLASCHEMA. This includes:

1. Language framework with support for multiple languages:

   - English, French, and Igbo language files
   - Database-backed translation storage with caching
   - Language detection based on multiple sources (URL, session, cookie, browser)
   - Persistent language selection with cookies

2. Translation management system:

   - Admin interface for managing translations
   - Import/export functionality for translations
   - Permission-based access control for translation management
   - Caching system for optimized performance

3. User interface components:
   - Language switcher with dropdown and inline display options
   - Visual indicators for current language
   - Accessibility considerations for language selection

The multilingual system enables the site to be viewed in multiple languages, improving accessibility for diverse user groups while maintaining a consistent user experience across all supported languages.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication Strategy**: Using Laravel Breeze with our implemented role-based permissions system for granular access control. Permission checks are now applied to all admin controllers.

2. **Activity Logging Approach**: Successfully implemented a dedicated service for activity logging with controller-level integration for all main admin actions (create, update, delete). Entity-specific log views provide focused audit trails for each module with filtering options by action type and date range.

3. **Image Processing Approach**: Implemented responsive image processing with Intervention Image to generate multiple sizes for different devices. We're creating small (400px), medium (800px), and large (1200px) versions of each uploaded image along with the original for optimal performance across devices. Added format-specific optimizations with appropriate compression levels for each image type and size.

4. **Testing Priority**: Focusing on feature tests for critical admin operations first, then expanding to browser tests. Need to add tests for the newly implemented permission system, activity logging functionality, and responsive image handling.

5. **Caching Implementation**: Implemented Redis-based caching with a comprehensive CacheService for improved performance and cache management. Added automatic cache invalidation through model observers and enhanced cache key generation. Implemented cache tagging for more targeted cache clearing and improved the overall caching strategy.

6. **Contact Message Management**:

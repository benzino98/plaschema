# Active Context: PLASCHEMA Project

## Current Focus

We have successfully implemented all of the planned UI enhancements to improve the visual appearance and functionality of the PLASCHEMA website. These enhancements included adding icons, creating a dynamic news section, standardizing image sizes, and adjusting button styles for better consistency.

Our current focus is now on implementing an API integration to fetch enrollment statistics from an external API and display them in the statistics section on the home page.

### New API Integration Plan

We will develop a solution to integrate with the external API at https://plaschema.app/api/data-records to fetch real enrollment data for display in the statistics section. The key requirements include:

1. Display five enrollment statistics:

   - Total Enrollments (using total_count)
   - Formal Enrollments (using formal_count)
   - Informal Enrollments (using total_informal_count)
   - BHCPF Enrollments (using bhcpf_count)
   - Equity Enrollments (using equity_count)

2. Cache the API request to avoid frequent calls, using the standard 1-hour cache duration
3. Use last cached values if API fails
4. Show cached data first, then update in background if needed
5. Update UI layout from 4 cards to 5 cards with appropriate icons

The implementation will follow these phases:

- Phase 1: Create a dedicated ApiService for external API requests
- Phase 2: Integrate with existing CacheService for efficient caching
- Phase 3: Update the HomeController and home page view
- Phase 4: Implement background updates via JavaScript
- Phase 5: Add comprehensive testing and error handling

This implementation will adhere to the project's established patterns, particularly the service-based architecture and caching strategy.

The UI enhancements that were implemented include:

1. **Health Plans Card Icons and Link Removal**:

   - COMPLETED: Added Heroicon SVG icons to each health plan card on the home page
   - COMPLETED: Removed the "Learn More" links to simplify the card design
   - COMPLETED: Ensured proper vertical alignment and visual balance

2. **Statistics Section Icons**:

   - COMPLETED: Added appropriate Heroicon SVG icons to each statistics card
   - COMPLETED: Styled icons to match the dark background and white text theme
   - COMPLETED: Maintained responsive design across all screen sizes

   - COMPLETED: Created a new HomeController to fetch the 3 most recent news articles
   - COMPLETED: Implemented caching for better performance
   - COMPLETED: Replaced static news cards with a loop over the fetched articles
   - COMPLETED: Added links to the actual news article pages
   - COMPLETED: Implemented a placeholder SVG for news without images
   - COMPLETED: Added cache invalidation through a NewsObserver

4. **Leadership Image Standardization**:

   - COMPLETED: Set consistent dimensions for leadership images on the about page
   - COMPLETED: Implemented proper image sizing with object-fit
   - COMPLETED: Matched image sizing with news card images

5. **Button Color Consistency**:

   - COMPLETED: Updated button colors on the health plans page to match the brand colors
   - COMPLETED: Ensured hover states are consistent with other buttons on the site
   - COMPLETED: Verified color contrast for accessibility

6. **Search Button Height Adjustment**:
   - COMPLETED: Fixed the height of the search button on the provider page
   - COMPLETED: Aligned button with adjacent input field
   - COMPLETED: Maintained responsive behavior across screen sizes

Previously, we successfully implemented subtle modern animations, fade effects, and shadow enhancements to give the PLASCHEMA website a more professional and polished appearance. This initiative enhances the user experience with thoughtful micro-interactions while maintaining excellent performance across devices and browsers.

We also implemented the multilingual support system for PLASCHEMA and begun work on the DevOps and deployment aspects of the project.

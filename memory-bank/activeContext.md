## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication Strategy**: Using Laravel Breeze with our implemented role-based permissions system for granular access control. Permission checks are now applied to all admin controllers.

2. **Activity Logging Approach**: Successfully implemented a dedicated service for activity logging with controller-level integration for all main admin actions (create, update, delete). Entity-specific log views provide focused audit trails for each module with filtering options by action type and date range.

3. **Image Processing Approach**: Implemented responsive image processing with Intervention Image to generate multiple sizes for different devices. We're creating small (400px), medium (800px), and large (1200px) versions of each uploaded image along with the original for optimal performance across devices.

4. **Testing Priority**: Focusing on feature tests for critical admin operations first, then expanding to browser tests. Need to add tests for the newly implemented permission system, activity logging functionality, and responsive image handling.

5. **Caching Implementation**: Implemented file-based caching for frequently accessed data with clear invalidation strategies. We're caching news listings, provider data, and unread message counts with appropriate expiration times. Planning to move to Redis in the future for better performance.

6. **Contact Message Management**:

   - Messages are stored in the database with automatic archiving after 3 months
   - Using in-app notifications for new messages via Laravel's notification system
   - Admin users can mark messages as "responded to" after replying from their email client
   - Implemented message categories to aid in triaging
   - Only showing a simple success message to users after form submission
   - Restricted message management to super admin role only
   - Added scheduled task for automatic archiving

7. **Bulk Operations Strategy**:

   - Implemented contextual bulk actions specific to each content type
   - Added thorough validation and permission checking for all bulk operations
   - Integrated with activity logging system for audit purposes
   - Used JavaScript for client-side validation before submission
   - Implemented mobile-responsive design for all bulk operation UI elements
   - Added confirmation dialogs with context-specific messages for each action

8. **Responsive Image Strategy**:
   - Using standard HTML5 srcset and sizes attributes for responsive images
   - Generating images at 400px, 800px, and 1200px widths while maintaining aspect ratio
   - Using lazy loading for all images to improve initial page load times
   - Added Blade component for consistent responsive image implementation
   - Created command to generate responsive versions of existing images

### Design & UX Decisions

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Improved mobile experience across the entire site with responsive image handling that delivers appropriately sized images based on device screen width.

2. **Form Feedback Strategy**: Implementing immediate inline validation feedback rather than submitting the form to show errors.

3. **Admin Dashboard Layout**: Redesigning the admin dashboard to show key metrics and recent activities for better at-a-glance information.

4. **Theming System**: Considering the implementation of a light/dark mode toggle based on user preferences.

5. **Contact Message Interface**: Implementing a clean listing interface with status indicators, filtering options by category and status, and a detailed view for individual messages with response tracking. Added in-app notifications for new messages.

6. **Bulk Operations Interface**:

   - Used checkboxes with "Select All" option for intuitive selection
   - Implemented context-specific action dropdowns for each content type
   - Added inline feedback for bulk operations through success/error messages
   - Created a custom category management UI for FAQ bulk categorization

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implemented caching for all listing pages and detail views
   - Using responsive images to reduce bandwidth usage on mobile devices
   - Added lazy loading for images to improve initial page load time
   - Optimized database queries to reduce server response time

### Product Decisions

1. **Feature Prioritization**: Healthcare provider search and filtering features have been prioritized based on user feedback.

2. **Content Management Flow**: Streamlining the content creation process with a more intuitive workflow, including image optimization.

3. **User Account Requirements**: Determining what level of user registration is required for public site features.

4. **Contact Message Workflow**:

   - New messages trigger in-app notifications for super admin users
   - Super admin reviews and can update status (new â†’ read â†’ responded â†’ archived)
   - Using predefined categories: General Inquiry, Enrollment Question, Provider Question, Feedback, Technical Issue
   - Messages are automatically archived after 3 months
   - Added scheduled task for automatic archiving of old messages

5. **Bulk Operations Workflow**:

   - Creating intuitive selection and action flows for admin users
   - Implementing appropriate confirmation steps to prevent accidental data changes
   - Providing clear feedback on action results
   - Enabling efficient management of large data sets

6. **Image Optimization Strategy**:
   - Automatic generation of responsive image sizes on upload
   - Using modern srcset attributes for optimal browser selection
   - Implementing lazy loading for improved performance
   - Proper caching of images with appropriate cache headers

### Current Challenges

1. **Activity Log Volume**: Managing potential high volume of activity logs over time (consider log rotation or archiving).

2. **Image Upload Performance**: Large image uploads are now handled more efficiently with the responsive image processing system, but may still cause performance issues for very large files.

3. **Test Data Generation**: Creating realistic test data that covers edge cases for comprehensive testing.

4. **Cache Invalidation**: Ensuring that cached data is properly invalidated when content is updated.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring responsive images and lazy loading work consistently across all browsers.

## Team Focus

- **Backend Development**: Further performance optimization and image processing improvements
- **Frontend Development**: Implementing lazy loading for remaining image-heavy pages
- **QA & Testing**: Testing the new responsive image system and caching implementation across different devices
- **DevOps**: Setting up automated deployment pipeline for staging environment

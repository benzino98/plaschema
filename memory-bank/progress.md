## Current Status

The PLASCHEMA project has successfully implemented all core functionality for both the admin interface and public frontend. The system provides comprehensive CRUD operations for all primary models (News, HealthcareProvider, FAQ, Category) with solid validation and error handling. The admin interface features search, pagination, and basic filtering capabilities, while the public frontend presents content in a responsive, user-friendly manner.

Recent progress has been significant, with the successful implementation of:

1. RESTful API endpoints for all major resources (News, HealthcareProvider, FAQ, Contact)
2. API authentication using Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication
3. Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger annotations
4. Integration of the API with the CacheService for improved performance
5. Role-based access control for protected API endpoints

The API implementation is now complete, providing:

- Public endpoints for retrieving resources
- Protected endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting resources
- Authentication with token-based system
- Comprehensive filtering options
- Pagination support
- Cache integration for improved performance
- Detailed API documentation

## Known Issues

### Admin Interface

1. Large image uploads sometimes cause performance issues

### Public Frontend

1. Some older browsers may not fully support lazy loading features

### Infrastructure

1. Test coverage incomplete for newer features
2. No automated performance testing
3. Local file storage not suitable for production
4. No monitoring system for production environment
5. No Redis monitoring system for tracking cache performance

## Next Priorities

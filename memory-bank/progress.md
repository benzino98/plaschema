## Current Status

The PLASCHEMA project has successfully implemented all core functionality for both the admin interface and public frontend. The system provides comprehensive CRUD operations for all primary models (News, HealthcareProvider, FAQ, Category) with solid validation and error handling. The admin interface features search, pagination, and basic filtering capabilities, while the public frontend presents content in a responsive, user-friendly manner.

Recent progress has been significant, with the successful implementation of:

1. Advanced Search Functionality with multi-criteria filtering (content type, category, location), full-text search across all content types, and intuitive filter UI
2. Redis-based Caching System with a comprehensive CacheService for improved performance, automatic cache invalidation, and enhanced cache key generation
3. Cache tagging for more targeted cache clearing and improved overall caching strategy
4. Integration of the search system with caching for optimized performance
5. Refactoring of all controllers to use the new CacheService

The advanced search functionality has been completely implemented, including:

- Dedicated search page with intuitive interface
- Multi-criteria filtering by content type, category, and location
- Full-text search across all major content types
- Visual filter tags with one-click removal
- Type-specific results display
- Responsive search UI for all devices
- Empty state handling with suggestions

The Redis caching system has been fully implemented, including:

- Redis configuration in Laravel environment
- Creation of a comprehensive CacheService for consistent caching approach
- Implementation of automatic cache invalidation through model observers
- Enhanced cache key generation with model context
- Cache tagging for targeted cache clearing
- Helper methods for common caching patterns
- Consistent cache durations with configurable defaults
- Integration of the CacheService with all controllers

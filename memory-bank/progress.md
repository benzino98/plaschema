## Current Status

The PLASCHEMA project has successfully implemented all core functionality for both the admin interface and public frontend. The system provides comprehensive CRUD operations for all primary models (News, HealthcareProvider, FAQ, Category) with solid validation and error handling. The admin interface features search, pagination, and basic filtering capabilities, while the public frontend presents content in a responsive, user-friendly manner.

Recent progress has been significant, with the successful implementation of:

1. A responsive image system with multiple sizes for different devices
2. A notification system for new contact messages
3. Automatic archiving of older messages
4. Caching for frequently accessed data
5. Performance optimizations throughout the application

The responsive image system has been completely implemented, including:

- Database schema for storing multiple image sizes
- Service to generate and manage responsive images
- Blade component for consistent image display across the site
- Command to generate responsive versions of existing images
- Integration with all content types that use images

The notification system for new contact messages has been fully implemented:

- Database schema for storing notifications
- Notification class for new contact messages
- Integration with contact message creation
- Notification delivery to super admin users

The caching implementation has been fully completed:

- Caching for news listings and detail pages
- Caching for provider listings and detail pages
- Caching for categories and other frequently accessed data
- Cache invalidation strategies for content updates

## Known Issues

### Admin Interface

1. Large image uploads sometimes cause performance issues
2. Validation error messaging inconsistent across forms
3. Browser compatibility issues with some CSS animations

### Public Frontend

1. Provider search performance degrades with large datasets
2. Some images may not be fully optimized for mobile
3. Limited filtering options for provider listings

### Infrastructure

1. Test coverage incomplete for newer features
2. No automated performance testing
3. Local file storage not suitable for production
4. No monitoring system for production environment

## Next Priorities

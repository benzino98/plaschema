## Current Status

The PLASCHEMA project has successfully implemented all core functionality for both the admin interface and public frontend. The system provides comprehensive CRUD operations for all primary models (News, HealthcareProvider, FAQ, Category) with solid validation and error handling. The admin interface features search, pagination, and basic filtering capabilities, while the public frontend presents content in a responsive, user-friendly manner.

Recent progress has been significant, with the successful implementation of:

1. A complete role-based permission system with a user interface for managing roles and assigning permissions
2. A comprehensive activity logging system for tracking admin actions with entity-specific log views
3. Improved mobile responsiveness in the admin interface

The role-based permission system has been fully implemented, including:

- Database models and migrations for roles and permissions
- Middleware for checking permissions and roles
- Admin interface for managing roles and permissions
- Seeders for creating default roles with appropriate permissions
- Integration with all controllers to enforce proper authorization

The activity logging system has been completely implemented, providing:

- Comprehensive audit trails for all create, update, and delete operations
- Entity-specific log views for each module (News, FAQs, Providers, Roles, Users)
- Filtering options by action type and date range
- Detailed display of changes made in each operation
- Access control to ensure only authorized users can view logs

The contact message management system has been implemented, enabling:

- Storage and management of contact form submissions
- Categorization of messages (General Inquiry, Enrollment Question, Provider Question, Feedback, Technical Issue)
- Status tracking for messages (new, read, responded, archived)
- Admin interface for super admins to view and manage messages
- Message filtering by status, category, and date range
- Ability to mark messages as responded to after replying via email
- Integration with activity logging for comprehensive audit trails

## Known Issues

### Admin Interface

1. Image uploads sometimes fail with larger files
2. Validation error messaging inconsistent across forms
3. No bulk operations for efficient resource management
4. Contact message link may not be visible to super admin users
5. In-app notifications for new messages not yet implemented
6. Automatic archiving of messages not yet implemented

### Public Frontend

1. Provider search performance degrades with large datasets
2. Mobile navigation needs refinement for better usability
3. Image optimization issues on image-heavy pages
4. No print-friendly views for content
5. Limited filtering options for provider listings
6. Contact form has no backend functionality to process submissions

### Infrastructure

1. Test coverage incomplete for newer features
2. No automated performance testing
3. Local file storage not suitable for production
4. Missing caching for frequently accessed data
5. No monitoring system for production environment

## Next Priorities

- Implement responsive image handling
- Ensure consistent UI across devices

  2.**Optimize performance**

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Improve image handling for better performance
- Optimize database queries for listing pages

  3.**Implement bulk operations**

- Add batch editing functionality for relevant resources
- Implement batch deletion with proper confirmation
- Ensure all bulk operations are properly logged

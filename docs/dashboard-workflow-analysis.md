## Workflow Frequency Analysis

Based on typical usage patterns, we've analyzed the frequency of different admin actions:

| Respond to contact messages | Daily     | High     |
| Check activity logs         | Daily     | High     |
| Update healthcare providers | Weekly    | Medium   |
| Create/Edit FAQs            | Weekly    | Medium   |
| Upload resources            | Weekly    | Medium   |
| Manage users                | Monthly   | Low      |
| Update translations         | Monthly   | Low      |
| Modify permissions/roles    | Rarely    | Low      |

## Task Sequences

2. View dashboard for content metrics
3. Create new content (news/FAQ/resource)
4. Publish and verify on site
5. Check activity logs to confirm

### Message Response Workflow

1. Log in to admin panel
2. Check dashboard for new message count
3. View message inbox
4. Respond to messages
5. Mark as resolved
6. Return to dashboard

### User Management Workflow

1. Log in to admin panel
2. View user statistics on dashboard
3. Access user management section
4. Create/update user accounts
5. Assign roles/permissions
6. Return to dashboard

## Dashboard Component Prioritization

Based on the workflow analysis, we've prioritized the dashboard components:

### High Priority (Always Visible)

1. **Content Quick Stats**: Counts of key content types
2. **Message Alert Panel**: New and unread messages
3. **Quick Actions Bar**: Create news, respond to messages
4. **Recent Activity Feed**: Latest system activities
5. **Content Growth Chart**: Trend visualization

### Medium Priority (Prominently Placed)

1. **Healthcare Provider Stats**: Distribution by type
2. **Content Quick Access**: Recent news, FAQs, etc.
3. **Resource Download Stats**: Popular documents
4. **System Notifications**: Important alerts

### Lower Priority (Available but Less Prominent)

1. **User Management Stats**: User counts by role
2. **Translation Status**: Completion percentages
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed metrics
4. **System Configuration**: Settings access

## Component Placement Strategy

Based on the analysis, the dashboard will follow this general layout:

1. **Top Row**: Critical metrics and alerts (content counts, new messages)
2. **Second Row**: Quick action buttons for high-frequency tasks
3. **Third Row**: Data visualizations (charts and graphs)
4. **Fourth Row**: Recent activity and content
5. **Bottom Section**: Less frequently used metrics and actions

## Responsive Considerations

When viewed on smaller screens, components will collapse in this order:

1. Keep critical alerts and metrics visible
2. Maintain quick action access
3. Collapse charts but keep accessible via tabs
4. Stack recent activity below
5. Move lower priority items to expandable sections

## User Testing Approach

We'll validate this workflow analysis through:

1. **Heatmap Testing**: Track where administrators focus their attention
2. **Task Completion Timing**: Measure how long common tasks take to complete
3. **Satisfaction Surveys**: Gather feedback on dashboard usability
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare different component arrangements

## Conclusion

This workflow analysis indicates that our dashboard should prioritize content management and communication features, with easy access to activity monitoring. User management and system configuration, while important, are less frequent activities that can occupy less prominent positions in the dashboard layout.
